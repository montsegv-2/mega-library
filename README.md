| The project is focused on user needs, such as organizing books, tracking reading habits, and discovering new books. This ensures the platform will be relevant and useful. | Although the objectives are clear, technical details on how they will be implemented are lacking. This led to problems during development. | Identify and prioritize the key features that need to be developed first. This will help me manage the time I have to develop the project and ensure that the most important features are delivered on time. |
